Summary





# Inspiration

In need of an idea? Look no further

# What it does

Generates winning hackathon ideas using machine learning

# How I built it

We scraped winning hackathon tagline and titles using ui path

We trained a Gpt2 so that we could generate realistic descriptions of hackathons

We used an online api to match our taglines with titles and matching images, falling back to google image search

We built a web backend using flask and mongodb atlas that stores our data



# Challenges I ran into



# Accomplishments that I'm proud of 



# What I learned



# What's next for hackhacks

Build a hackathon project idea generated using our algorithm. We've noticed many incredible ideas come out of the algorithm such as 

# Built with

Mongodb Atlas, python, flask, bootstrap, javascript

# Try it out
